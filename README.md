# porter2
A python wrapper around surgebase's porter2 implimentation. 

The surgebase library impliments a finate state machine and as such has very good performance.

## Usage
```python
from porter2 import stem

print(stem("running"))
# "run"
```

## What does the python library do?
In order to make this wrapper library I took the porter2.go file from Surgebase, made a few small modifications including
making the stem function accept and return C strings and renaming the package to main.
I then compiled that file to C, and provided a [small wrapper](https://github.com/kajuberdut/porter2/blob/main/porter2/__init__.py) to call the C version.

Becuase the C version of porter2.go is 2.4 MB, I went ahead and compressed it using Python's built in bz2 and added the [zipper module](https://github.com/kajuberdut/porter2/blob/main/porter2/surgebase/zipper.py) to unzip it
on first use. The bz2 version is about 0.8 MB. As a result of the decompression step, the very first time porter2 is imported it will take a small amount of time longer than future imports.

## Credits and Info
I'm not clear on the relationship between surgebase and Jian Zhen but zhenjl appears to deserve authorship credit and surgebase is where I found the go implimentation.
